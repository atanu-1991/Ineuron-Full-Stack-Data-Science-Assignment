    "#### 1. Define the Bayesian interpretation of probability.\n",
    "**Ans:** Bayesian probability is the study of subjective probabilities or belief in an outcome, compared to the frequentist approach where probabilities are based purely on the past occurrence of the event. A Bayesian Network captures the joint probabilities of the events represented by the model."

    "**Ans:** The general probability addition rule for the union of two events states that P(A∪B)=P(A)+P(B)−P(A∩B), where A∩B is the intersection of the two sets."

    "#### 3. What is joint probability? What is its formula?\n",
    "**Ans:** Probabilities are combined using multiplication, therefore the joint probability of independent events is calculated as the probability of event A multiplied by the probability of event B. This can be stated formally as follows:\n",

    "**Ans:** The chain rule, or general product rule, calculates any component of the joint distribution of a set of random variables using only conditional probabilities. This probability theory is used as a foundation for backpropagation and in creating Bayesian networks."

    "Conditional probability is calculated by multiplying the probability of the preceding event by the updated probability of the succeeding, or conditional, event.\n",

    "**Ans:** A continuous random variable X takes all values in a given interval of numbers. ▪ The probability distribution of a continuous random variable is shown by a density curve. ▪ The probability that X is between an interval of numbers is the area under the density curve between the interval endpoints."

    "\n",
    "In statistics, a Poisson distribution is a probability distribution that is used to show how many times an event is likely to occur over a specified period. ... The Poisson distribution is a discrete function, meaning that the variable can only take specific values in a (potentially infinite) list."
